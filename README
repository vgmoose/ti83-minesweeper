This was programmed on the TI83SE during my Sophomore year of high school.

The idea was from a friend, to make a minesweeper program. I didn't realize
it at the time, but the algorithm here is an iterative version of 
FloodFill, which utilizes Lists (arrays on the 83) to keep track of 
which mines need to be flipped.

It uses an external library for the 83 called omnicalc which allows the 
calculator to draw pictures easier. The pictures are first drawn as
the game "loads" and then stored to memory. They are then treated like
a sprite sheet. Any call to a Real( command is likely utilizing this
library.

This was programmed on the calculator. It originally did not have
the automatic flipping of tiles around (the floodfill part) and only
generated and played minesweeper maps. Eventually support was added for
this though, and a changelog was also added.

Data is stored by saving it all to a custom list and then writing that list
to the Archive memory. There's a value in the list that tracks the version
number, and that is how the changelog works. There's also a value
keeping track of whether or not the omnicalc notice and check has been
performed, and if not where to get it at. Preferences and high scores
are stored too.

Automatic tile flipping is a little slow. You can play the program
by loading it onto a TI83 Debugger emulator, which TI supplies for
free on their website.
